## Introduction
As it is known, Kuwait lies in a harsh desert environment. And regardless of having the
black gold living under its sands (oil), Kuwait’s economic engine, the desert is causing a lot of
trouble to the country both on the health and economic levels. Sand likes to take a breath and fly
with the hot summer winds and February’s unstable climate, and once it finds an obstacle or a
place to live in, it starts to accumulate. Sand accumulation on roads and streets is a significant problem facing Kuwait and the nearby countries. The sands impede the move ment of vehicles and cause car accidents. Furthermore, it stands in the way of expanding and developing new cities and costs the coun try thousands of dinars every year. {{< youtube R5vC4ELWWHY >}}
