And regardless of having the black gold living under its sands (oil), Kuwait’s economic engine, the desert is causing a lot of trouble to the country both on the health and economic levels. Sand likes to take a breath and fly with the hot summer winds and February’s unstable climate, and once it finds an obstacle or a place to live in, it starts to accumulate. Sand accumulation on roads and streets is a significant problem facing Kuwait and the nearby countries. The sands impede the move ment of vehicles and cause car accidents. Furthermore, it stands in the way of expanding and developing new cities and costs the coun try thousands of dinars every year.

Concept Generation \u0026amp; Selection The team listed all necessary functions of the product in order to generate concepts that could achieve these functions. A structured approach was made to make for a more effective decision on the final concept. All the concepts that were generated went through a concept screening and scoring method to obtain the relatively best concept. The table below shows the final concept selected for the project.\n"},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Sandplower/04_detaildesign/","title":"Detailed Design","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Feasibility We started with the initial design shown below to ensure the feasibility of the project. The material used in our analysis is Steel AISI 1020, and the study was based on the worst scenario: no tires to curry the frame and the car attachment carries all loads. Therefore, all stresses were obtained are the von misses stress. There were two loads in the feasibility study, the gravity and the frame weight caused the first load, and the second load is sand Pushing.\nIt was found that the maximum von mises stresses were on the plow hinges and the car mounting (front hitch). Hence, these locations must be supported. The factor of safety was 1.787; hence, the maximum load is 37527N. So, this tool is overdesigned, and the thickness of the beams needs to be decreased. The table below summarizes the results.\nQuantity Value Applied Load 21,000 N FOS 1.787 Maximum Load 37,527 N \u0026gt; 3825 Kg (Small elephant) Changing to Smaller Dimensions As seen in the previous section, the system was overdesigned, with a very high beams thickness and weight. Also, the last beam dimensions do not meet the stock beams available in the market. A list of all the available beams in the stock has been obtained from the HADIDCO company. All beams in the frame were changed to meet the stocks. Also, the plow hinges were removed, and the plow was welded to the frame directly. By doing this step, the team gets rid of the plow stresses in the previous section. The disturbed load was decreased to 7000N, and the team made many iterations until the best size was reached. The last iteration size was 50mmx50mmx5mm.\nThe results of the stress analysis after changing the dimensions show that the maximum stress was 185.5 [MPa], and the bearing stress of the cylinder allowed the half front of the frame to rotate. However, the stress still does not exceed the maximum allowable stress, and the safety factor is perfect and equal to 1.9; hence, the last iteration\u0026rsquo;s thickness is suitable.\nAdding a Third Bar The safety factor in the last iteration is only suitable for static loading; however, in this case, the load is dynamic, and the car\u0026rsquo;s acceleration significantly impacts the system. The load could be higher than the static load if the acceleration were high; therefore, the team decided to add a third bar in the middle to double the safety factor. A third bar in the middle was added with the same size as the other bars, and the safety factor increased dramatically from 1.9 to 6.3. This change will ensure that the dynamic load will not break the frame at its stress concentrations.\nChanging the Plow Shape The plow was designed to be curved on the half top since the sands will start to accumulate and build up, and if there is no curvature, the sands will cross the plow from the top. The analysis of this shape takes much time due to the mesh complexity; more than one day is needed to analyze the system when this plow is used. The team decided to simplify the curvature and make it double angled. The first angle is 20 degrees, and the second one is 40 degrees. The analysis ran successfully after this simplification. Plow Edge Mechanism The figure below shows that the plow edge mechanism consists of a spring, rod, rotating cylinder, and screws. When a certain amount of force (it depends on how much the spring is pre-compressed) is applied to the edge of the plow, the edge will start to rotate, and the spring will be compressed. The middle bar helps the spring to remain vertically; however, the spring will tilt a little bit, and a larger hole on the top is needed. Car Mounting The figure below show the hook that will be attached to the SUV, the two bolts will be attached to the chassis, and the front square has a size same as the frame; hence this hook will act as a male and female attachment, and the frame bar will set inside the square. The hook is the most critical part of the project; if it fails, the whole project fails; hence, it was decided to overdesign it with very high loads and unrealistic scenarios. Two loads were applied to the hook, a vertical load of 300kg, double the weight of the whole system, and a horizontal load of 1000kg, which is almost one and half of the real sand plowing load. The two bolts were assumed to be fixed, and the analysis was done. The maximum stress does not exceed the yield stress, and the safety factor equals 2.31.

The manufacturing was outsourced and done by BMB workshop in Shuwaikh due to the fact that the prototype required skilled labor to manufacture. The available materials that were used for the prototype were:\n•\tAISI 1020 •\tHollow square tubes 5x5 [cm] with a thickness of 3[mm] •\tSolid Cylinder with a radius of 1.5 [cm] •\tSheet metal with a thickness of 3 [mm] The manufacturing started on the 28th of May. The prototype was categorized into four subassemblies; ready-made items; the plow; the frame; and finally, the car joints. This was done to allow for parts to be done in parallel.\nReady Made Items There were four ready made items for the prototype:\n•\tThe manual winch •\tThe AC motors •\tThe Tires •\tThe Street brushes The Frame The frame was split into two components called the chassis and the motor cage. The chassis is the supporting part of the frame while the motor cage is as the name suggests a resting mount for the motors and brushes. The chassis is composed of two main materials. The hollow square beams and the solid cylinder that allow for rotation. Relevant beams are first drilled using a drill bit for the cylinder to fit in the assembly of the component. Then the beams are joined together using welding and finally the cylinder is adjusted with a cylindrical metal bush in the joints. This allows for smoother rotation.\nThe Motor-Cage The brushes are not able to reach the ground if attached straight at the chassis. Therefore, the motors should be mounted closer to the ground and that is the reason for the designing of the motor cage. A by product of this design is to also create a point of stable attachment for the tires. The cage was manufactured using the same beams for the chassis and were joined by welding as well. As for the motors, a sheet metal was used to have a place for mounting the motor in place. This sheet metal had been punched out using a punching machine to be able to mount the motors.\nThe Plow The metal is simply sheet metal that has been bended using a bending machine. With small sheet metal welded behind the plow for support. A problem was encountered with manufacturing the plow subassembly. It was desired to implement a trip mechanism at the bottom of the plow which incorporates a trip spring system. However, due to complexity in the manufacturing and the lack of obtaining the correct springs for the applied force. It was not implemented into the subassembly.\nThe Car Joints The dimensions that were required were solid steel with a thickness of 5[cm]. the workshop available that could complete it in the appropriate time was a workshop that utilizes water jets for material removal processes. The problem that was encountered was that the machine could only cut a maximum of 2 [cm]. Therefore, through improvisation, the joints were cut as 4 pieces of 2[cm] thick car joints. The Assembly After all the subassemblies were made and ready, all that was left was to assemble each of them and complete the manufacturing process. The motor cage, chassis and plow were all assembled by welding and the car joint was attached using bolts and pins.

The sands impede the movement of vehicles and cause car accidents. Furthermore, it stands in the way of expanding and developing new cities and costs the country thousands of dinars every year. The team’s mission was to find a solution to this problem. An engineering design process was followed during a full academic semester. Starting with setting target specifications obtained from customer interviews and proceeding through concept development and system-level design, in which techniques such as concept scoring and concept screening were used. The design process ended with a detailed design in which CAD software packages were used to determine mechanical stress and specific dimensions for the product. A prototype was manufactured, however, some features were eliminated due to the limited time of the project. The prototype was tested after. The test was successful in most criteria despite having some issues with some features. Finally, an economic analysis was done to study the feasibility of the project from an economic point of view and the project was found to be feasible and profitable.\nFinal Report Project Poster Contact us : SandSweeperKU@gmail.com\n"},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Sandplower/categories/","title":"Categories","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Sandplower/tags/","title":"Tags","tags":[],"description":"","content":""}]
