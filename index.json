And regardless of having the black gold living under its sands (oil), Kuwait’s economic engine, the desert is causing a lot of trouble to the country both on the health and economic levels. Sand likes to take a breath and fly with the hot summer winds and February’s unstable climate, and once it finds an obstacle or a place to live in, it starts to accumulate. Sand accumulation on roads and streets is a significant problem facing Kuwait and the nearby countries. The sands impede the move ment of vehicles and cause car accidents. Furthermore, it stands in the way of expanding and developing new cities and costs the coun try thousands of dinars every year. Mission Statement Product Description A car attachment with road sweeping and bulldozing capabilities. Specialized for removing the accumulated very fine sand on the roads.

Concept Generation \u0026amp; Selection The team listed all necessary functions of the product in order to generate concepts that could achieve these functions. A structured approach was made to make for a more effective decision on the final concept. All the concepts that were generated went through a concept screening and scoring method to obtain the relatively best concept. The table below shows the final concept selected for the project.\n"},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Sandplower/04_detaildesign/","title":"Detailed Design","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Analysis Method "},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Sandplower/05_manufacturing/","title":"Manufacturing","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Manufacturing "},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Sandplower/","title":"","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Sand sweeper By : Eng.

Mosab Marafi\nAbstract The idea of this product came from the need to find a more practical, less resource consuming solution to the problem of sand accumulation on roads. After researching the problem, interviewing the engineers of the ministry of public works, and studying similar products used in different environmental conditions. The Sand Sweeper was designed using SOLIDWORKS software based on the demands of the regional climate, Being the first of its kind in the field of sand removal. It was tested in real life and approved its efficiency while providing a time and money-saving solution.\nReports : Project Plan and Product Target Specifications\nConcept Generation and System-Level Design\nProject poster : Contact us : SandSweeperKU@gmail.com\n"},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Sandplower/categories/","title":"Categories","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://me459ku.github.io/Sandplower/tags/","title":"Tags","tags":[],"description":"","content":""}]
